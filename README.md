Fm Radio Receiver 4 Transistors

Here is a very simple and effective circuit using only 4 transistors. The materials used are listed below. What are BC547 and BF199? I will explain them to you.



A radio receiver is an electronic device that receives radio waves and converts the information carrying them into a useful form. Used with an antenna. The antenna cuts the radio waves and converts them into alternating currents applied to the receiver, and the receiver outputs the desired information.



BC547

BC547 is an NPN Transistor commonly used in low power amplifier circuits. The NPN Bipolar Transistor is designed for use in linear and switching applications. It is contained in a TO-92 case designed for medium power applications. It is suitable for use with microcontrollers.

Equivalent Transistors:

2N2222, 2N3904, 2N4401, BC337 (Some transistors' pin configuration is different from BC547, check the pin configuration before changing it in a circuit)

 Usage areas

Sensor Circuits

Audio Preamp circuits

Audio Amplifier Stages

Switching Loads Below 100mA
